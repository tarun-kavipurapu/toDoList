This is a simple Express.js application that interacts with a MongoDB database to manage todos. It includes routes to get all todos, get a specific todo by ID, create a new todo, and delete a todo.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

- React js for Frontend
- Also used Tailwind

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Replace the MongoDB Atlas URI in the code:

   Replace the URI in the `mongoose.connect()` function call with your own MongoDB Atlas URI.

## Usage
